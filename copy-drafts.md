# Copy Drafts — Human-First & Why LATAM

## Hero Options (Human-First Angle)

### Option A — Direct contrast
> **Recruiting got automated. We didn't.**
>
> While everyone else builds AI to scan resumes, we actually talk to engineers. Real interviews. Real conversations. Real judgment. That's how you find people who ship.

### Option B — Call out the problem
> **Algorithms don't know who will thrive on your team. We do.**
>
> No keyword matching. No AI screening. We interview engineers ourselves — technical skills, communication, culture fit. Then we introduce you to 3-5 people worth your time.

### Option C — Simple and confident
> **No AI. No algorithms. Just people who know engineers.**
>
> We're based in Mexico City. We know the LATAM engineering community firsthand. We vet candidates ourselves — because a resume doesn't tell you if someone can ship.

### Option D — Flip the script
> **Your next hire shouldn't be picked by a robot.**
>
> AI recruiting tools match keywords. We match people. Real technical interviews by engineers. Real conversations about what you actually need. That's it.

## Why LATAM Section

### Option A — Practical and direct
> **Why LATAM?**
>
> **Same hours.** Engineers in Mexico City, São Paulo, and Bogotá work when you do. Real standups. Real collaboration. No waiting 12 hours for a Slack reply.
>
> **Senior talent.** LATAM has been producing world-class engineers for decades. Many have worked at US companies, speak fluent English, and understand American work culture.
>
> **Real savings.** Competitive rates without compromising on quality. You're not paying Bay Area prices, but you're getting Bay Area caliber.

### Option B — Story-driven
> **Why LATAM?**
>
> The best-kept secret in tech hiring isn't a secret anymore.
>
> Latin America has senior engineers who studied at top universities, worked at US companies, and ship production code daily. They speak English. They work your hours. They cost less than SF — but not because they're worth less.
>
> The timezone alone changes everything. No more async-only collaboration. No more waiting until tomorrow for code review. Your team actually works together.

### Option C — Bullet-style
> **Why hire in Latin America?**
>
> - **Timezone overlap** — EST, CST, PST compatible. Real-time collaboration.
> - **Deep talent pool** — Senior engineers with US company experience.
> - **English fluency** — Communication isn't a barrier.
> - **Cost efficiency** — 30-50% savings without quality tradeoffs.
> - **Cultural alignment** — Familiar with American work culture and expectations.

## Methodology Rewrite (Human-First Focus)

### Current
> We Live Here / Fully Vetted / Same Clock

### Proposed
> **We don't automate. We investigate.**
>
> **Real conversations, not keyword matches.**
> Other agencies run your job description through an AI and send you 50 "matches." We pick up the phone. We ask engineers about their best work, their worst bugs, how they think through problems. You can't automate that.
>
> **Engineers interview engineers.**
> Your candidates aren't screened by recruiters reading from a script. They're interviewed by people who've shipped code, reviewed PRs, and debugged production at 2am. We know what good looks like.
>
> **We're in LATAM, not just hiring from it.**
> Based in Mexico City. Plugged into engineering communities across Latin America. We know who's actually good — not just who has the right keywords on LinkedIn.

## Tagline Alternatives

Current: "Senior talent. Your hours. Real work. No middlemen. They ship."

### Human-first options:
- "Recruiting without the robots."
- "AI matches keywords. We match people."
- "No algorithms. Just engineers who ship."
- "The human way to hire engineers."
- "Real vetting. Real people. Real results."

---

## One-Liner Options (for headers/subheads)

- "Everyone automated recruiting. We think that's the problem."
- "AI can parse a resume. It can't tell you who will thrive."
- "We still believe hiring is a human job."
- "The anti-AI recruiting agency."
- "Recruiting the old-fashioned way: actually talking to people."

## Combined Hero (Human-First + Why LATAM)

> **Recruiting without the robots. Engineers from Latin America.**
>
> While everyone else automates hiring, we do the opposite. Real interviews by real engineers. Candidates from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia — senior talent in your timezone, vetted by humans who know what good looks like.
>
> No AI screening. No keyword matching. Just 3-5 people worth your time.

## Notes

The human-first angle works because:
1. It's genuinely contrarian — everyone is racing to automate
2. It explains *why* your vetting is better (human judgment > algorithms)
3. It resonates with founders burned by low-quality AI matches
4. It's memorable and easy to repeat ("the agency that doesn't use AI")

The LATAM angle works because:
1. Timezone is the killer feature — real collaboration changes everything
2. Addresses the unspoken concern: "is the talent actually good?"
3. Cost savings is real but framed as value, not cheap labor
4. "We live here" adds authenticity other agencies can't claim
