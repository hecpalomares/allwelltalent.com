## Core Messaging

### Hero Copy
> **Recruiting got automated. We didn't.**
>
> While everyone else builds AI to scan resumes, we actually talk to engineers. Real interviews. Real conversations. Real judgment. That's how you find people who ship.

### Alternate Hero
> **Algorithms don't know who will thrive on your team. We do.**
>
> No keyword matching. No AI screening. We interview engineers ourselves — technical skills, communication, culture fit. Then we introduce you to 3-5 people worth your time.

### One-Liners (for headers/subheads)
- "Everyone automated recruiting. We think that's the problem."
- "AI can parse a resume. It can't tell you who will thrive."
- "We still believe hiring is a human job."
- "Recruiting the old-fashioned way: actually talking to people."

### Differentiators

| Phrase | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "No AI" | Human judgment over algorithmic matching |
| "Real work" | Long-term roles, not gigs |
| "They ship" | Engineers who deliver |
| "No middlemen" | Direct relationships |
| "Real standups" | Timezone overlap enables real-time collaboration |

## Methodology

### We don't automate. We investigate.

**Real conversations, not keyword matches.**
Other agencies run your job description through an AI and send you 50 "matches." We pick up the phone. We ask engineers about their best work, their worst bugs, how they think through problems. You can't automate that.

**Engineers interview engineers.**
Your candidates aren't screened by recruiters reading from a script. They're interviewed by people who've shipped code, reviewed PRs, and debugged production at 2am. We know what good looks like.

**We're in LATAM, not just hiring from it.**
Based in Mexico City. Plugged into engineering communities across Latin America. We know who's actually good — not just who has the right keywords on LinkedIn.

Latin America has been producing world-class engineers for decades. Many have worked at US companies, speak fluent English, and understand American work culture.
